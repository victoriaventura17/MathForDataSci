## Goals
Detect whther a person is in a pool or not, by using a security camera. This will help lessen drowning deaths.
## Why is this important?
Drowning deaths are one of the top reasons for death in young children. Drowning deaths are preventable and can be prevented with safety guards in place. 

## Data Collection
Using AlexNet we can detect whether there is a person in a pool or not. The dataset used consisted of 25 pictures of people in pools and 25 pictures of pools without people inside.
